## 11.9.20XX
- Finished all the large parts!
- Now it's just a matter of gluing it all together.
- I can't wait to start working on a new game engine OwO.

## 10.8.20XX
- Guh, dealing with windows error reporting is going to be my death. The whole mechanism is in microsoft terms, immensly Un-thought trough.
- The best option seems to be having a debugger process that just places a breakpoints at important functions, and then waits for either an exception, or a crash.
- This would be great for linux too, but i'm unsure how it will affect performance. I'm hoping for this to be a feature of it's self, that you can just decide on.
- BTW this is like not at all what I'm working on, but I'm just trying to set in stone for future refference. just in case I'd have to alter the design to make it work.


## 6.8.20XX
- made the paging component, as much as I hate dealing with C style objects, this is all for a good reason.
- I'm hoping to make the entire thing run some basic allocation and deallocation code tonight :D
